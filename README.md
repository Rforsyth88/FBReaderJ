Official FBReaderJ project repository

The objective of this fork is to support (in addition to standard ebooks), the e-reading of classic plays.

Readers of plays have additional requirements over and above those of normal e-readers. In particular:
o The ability to display (on a status line) the Act / Scene currently being read.
o The ability to display (and turn off the display) notes of various types (director notes; source notes; meaning notes; etc)
o The ability to highlight with different background colours, the roles being read by a particular reader.
o The ability to create a set of different epubs from one master play epub + casting matrix for a play-readding group.

Thanks
